## Code review

### Branches

Each individual new feature or bug fix should have their own branch. The developer should push changes incrementally and periodically.

### Pull requests

Individual pull requests should be submitted to the `develop` branch and later reviewed by another developer.

### Merge PR
After a PR commit has been reviewed and approved, the committer is responsible for merging the branch to the `develop` branch and delete the merging branch.

We recommend using the **Squash and Merge** method when merging branches to the `develop` branch.
